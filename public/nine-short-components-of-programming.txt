The Nine components of programming

1. input / output   -- information into and out of your program






2. variables  -- store stuff






3. loops    --repeat stuff







4. decisions   --decide stuff based on stored stuff









5. functions     -- named group of code that can be called multiple times







6. Arrays -- a numbered list of variables







7. Objects   -- a named list of variables







8. events --trigger computer code







9. Classes  -- groups variables and functions to make programming easier
